In this paper we attempt to study the interaction of home production and hours constraints.  First, we consider a person who is deciding how to allocate his time between market work ($N$), home production ($H$), and leisure ($L$). Following 
\cite{gronau77} 
we assume the individual is indifferent between goods produced at home and those purchased in the market, i.e. for a commodity $X$, $X=X_{N}+X_{H}$ where $X_{N}$ is the amount of the commodity purchased in the market and $X_{H}$ is the amount produced at home. Note that this simplification abstracts from, say, market goods being normal and home produced goods being inferior.
